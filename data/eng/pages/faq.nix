      Will you dump your ETC immediately after the ICO?

    a = ''
      No, this creates market instability, and negatively affects our users.

      Will you pay your programmers in ETC?
    '';

      Yes, we'll endeavour to pay programmers in ETC.

      If I write a component and sell it to another programmer and they use my component in their hierarchy they will sell again will I be compensated?
    '';
    a = ''
      Yes, you own that component and wherever it is referenced you will receive compensation for your contribution.

    q = ''
      Why do you need an ICO?
    '';
    a = ''
      We need a currency for the marketplace, the currency should provide incentive to us to keep growing the value of the currency. The currency should also provide incentive to early backers to contribute to the project in many and varied ways.

      Will ETCDEV be compensated for their work on Emerald SDK?
    '';
    a = ''
      We'll definitely assist ETCDEV to wrap Fractalide components around their software and help them publish on the app marketplace thus they will be compensated for their work. As will anyone else creating components.

      ETC is in a unique position as it doesn't have a core development team with a large amount of premine/instamine, therefore it's expected that ICO parties on ETC should contribute towards the ETC core development. Do you intend on doing this?
    '';
    a = ''
      Absolutely, we hope we'll be able to build and maintain a new ETC client from this. Also we will be working closely with ETCDEV team on developing the core blockchain libraries.

    q = ''
      Does the ICO build out a revenue generating company that'll be able to pay programmers in the long term?
    '';
    a = ''
      Well, along with the premine which provides incentive to keep at the task the hopes are that enough revenue will be generated from the marketplace to build out a healthy company that hires enough programmers to maintain the infrastructure in a sustainable manner.
