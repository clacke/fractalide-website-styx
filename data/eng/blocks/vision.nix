    Fractalide aims to create a free and open rapid application development (RAD) platform with integrated proprietary marketplace, allowing one to purchase reuseable and reproducible applications. The RAD platform is based on Hypercard which allows non-programmers to mix and match components created by programmers. The RAD platform will then be extended to support ETCDEV's modular Emerald SDK libraries hence creating a new Ethereum Classic client. Thus the user has an all-in-one marketplace of commercially supported components, a cryptocurrency to pay for the components and a platform to compose, create, mix, match and run them on.
