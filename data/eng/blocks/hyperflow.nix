    Hyperflow draws much inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>. HyperCard was intuitive, semantically clear and easy to learn such that non-programmers could create powerful programs that solved real world problems at hand.
    <br>HyperCard had two modes; an execution mode and development mode. Switching between the two modes was trivial and didn't require a compilation step. In develop mode, people built their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) by dragging and dropping GUI widgets such as a button or textbox onto a canvas. This canvas was referred to as a Card. One could then write an English like programming language (called HyperTalk) to drive the execution of your Card GUI components and link Cards together. A set of Cards formed a Stack. The nearest analogy would be a Card is a web page and a Stack would be a website. People created Stacks which did anything from computer games to bookkeeping.

    <br><br>Hyperflow takes the good parts of HyperCard such as the simple intuitive development/execution environment that allows non-programmers to rapidly build applications, but chooses to reject certain shortcomings, namely not being able to share stacks over a network, and the English like language HyperTalk wasn't powerful enough for professional programmers.

    <br><br>We will swap out HyperTalk for a component oriented programming language called Flowscript (which is an implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-based Programming language</a>). These components are typically written in modern day programming languages and are <b>designed</b> to be shareable, reusable and reproducible. The nearest analogy is Lego. Programmers create the lego blocks and non-programmers use the Lego blocks. So in this environment we can create a synergy between programmers and non-programmers. Programmers retain their custom powerful development environments and non-programmers can easily use their components to build powerful applications to solve real world problems.

    <br><br>Which leads us to the next point. We need a way to share these powerful components with the world!
