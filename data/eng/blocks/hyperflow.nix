    Hyperflow draws much inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>. It allows programmers and non-programmers to easily build problem solving applications. Though we will make a few changes to it.
    <br><br>
    HyperCard concepts to keep:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The intuitive, semantically clear and easy to learn approach HyperCard is famous for.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's very easy to see and test what you just built, by simply switching between a run mode and execution mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the concept of cards and stack, where a good analogy is a card is a webpage and a stack is a website. Each card contains GUI components and logic that links all the other cards together to form an stack of cards.
      </li>
    </ul>
    HyperCard concepts to remove:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remove the HyperTalk programming language and replace it with Flowscript. HyperTalk isn't a powerful enough programming language for more serious apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design it such that stacks can be shareable and reproducible across networks of computers.
      </li>
    </ul>
