  Once the above HyperCard layer is completed applications can be built. A Marketplace app will be among the first few applications created. Very similar to how you have an Appstore app on your phone, this Fractalide Marketplace app allows you to search and pay for applications that run on Fractalide.

  <br><br>Though unlike the appstore, components that make up an application are shareable and may be included in other component hierachies. The original author is compensated for their work every time their component is sold even when it forms part of a component hierarchy created by another person.

  <br><br>These dynamics reward programmers for creating intuitive, reusable, efficient, well maintained components.

  <br><br>The last notable point about the marketplace is that a new cryptocurrency will be created enabling trade between buyers and sellers. This is the very same coin that can be purchased in the ICO.
