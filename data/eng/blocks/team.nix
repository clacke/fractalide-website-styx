    Fractalide started life as a Master Thesis in Universit√© catholique de Louvain under Professor Peter Van Roy back in 2014. Since then the project has undergone multiple rewrites in different programming languages, with new functionality and realizations. Every contribution helps us complete this undertaking. Thank you.
