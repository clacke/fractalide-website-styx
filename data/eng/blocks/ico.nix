    <b>Token Name:</b> Fractal Coin<br>
    <b>Token Symbol:</b> FRC<br>
    <b>Token Purpose:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Initial Coin Offering allows one to purchase FRACTAL coins which will be traded in the integrated marketplace.
      </li>
      <li>
        A buyer is someone who is prepared to offer FRACTALS for desired software available in the integrated marketplace that runs on Fractalide.
      </li>
      <li>
        A seller is someone who writes Fractalide compatible software and makes it available on the integrated marketplace and is prepared to accept FRACTALS in return.
      </li>
      <li>
        FRACTALS may also be used to contract programmers to write custom components.
      </li>
      <li>
        A component author will always be compensated upon every sale even if their component forms part of another programmer's component hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmers write components, non-programmers may compose components and sell them in the integrated marketplace. This Rapid Application Development environment is designed for non-programmers to solve problems. So money doesn't just flow to programmers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Please participate in the ICO over at Token Mint.
