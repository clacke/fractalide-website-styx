    <b>Token Name:</b> FRACTAL Coin<br>
    <b>Token Symbol:</b> FRC<br>
    <b>Token Purpose:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The FRACTAL coin will be traded between component sellers and buyers in the <a href="#fractalmarket">Fractalmarket</a>. This coin has real utility and not just speculative in nature.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Important note:</b><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        FRACTAL is <b>not</b> a security, you <b>cannot</b> earn dividends as FRACTAL does not represent company equity.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will not immediately convert your contributions into Fiat currency thus creating an unstable market, indeed we aim to pay salaries in ETC.
      </li>
      <li>
        It takes an entire open source community of people building, sharing, trading and contributing software for the FRACTAL coin to become valuable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Invest:</b><br>
