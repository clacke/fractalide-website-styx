  description = ''
    Fractalide started life as a Master Thesis in Université catholique de Louvain under Professor Peter Van Roy back in 2014. Since then the project has undergone multiple rewrites in different programming languages, with new functionality and realizations. Fractalide may now graduate the proof of concept stage into a fully fledged programming platform. We need your help and greatly appreciate your contributions.
