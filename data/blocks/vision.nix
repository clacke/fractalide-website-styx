    Fractalide aims to be a free and open rapid application development (RAD) platform with integrated marketplace, allowing one to purchase reuseable and reproducible applications. The RAD platform is based on Hypercard which allows non-programmers to mix and match components created by programmers into new applications. The RAD platform will then be extended to support ETCDEV's modular Emerald SDK libraries hence creating a new Ethereum Classic client. The integrated marketplace allows programmers and non-programmers to be compensated for their work even when their component is used in another person's published application. Thus the user has an all-in-one marketplace of commercially supported components, a cryptocurrency to pay for the components and a platform to compose, create, mix, match and run them on.
